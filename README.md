# Predicting whether a cheese is higher fat or not
This was my first machine learning project using Python for UBC's extended learning course, Introduction to Machine Learning ðŸ¤–

# Description
In this project, I trained and scored a model to classify a given cheese into the 'higher fat' or 'lower fat' classes. For this classification problem, higher fat is the positive label.

# Files Included
* _cheese_data.csv_ contains data on different types of Canadian cheeses. This includes information such as the manufacturing province, moisture percentage, category of cheese, fat level, etc. 
* _cheese_JUP.ipynb_ is a Jupyter Notebook that details the exploratory data analysis, methods, results, and discussion completed for this project.
